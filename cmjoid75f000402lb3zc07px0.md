A lot of people skipped [@Lighter\_xyz](http://app.lighter.xyz/?referral=LIGHTERDASH).

What’s funny is that many of the people who ended up with thousands of points weren’t whales at all. They were just regular traders who showed up early and stayed active.

Fast-forward, and those same points are now being priced at around $95 each. Not because anyone was a genius but because they were early.

That’s usually how this plays out. [Nado Exchange](https://app.nado.xyz/?join=n1sZrks) feels like that phase again.

[Nado](https://app.nado.xyz/?join=n1sZrks) is a perp DEX built on @inkonchain , the L2 from the Kraken team.

Right now it’s in closed alpha, and that matters more than people realize.

This is the phase people reference later even if nobody was loud about it at the time. You don’t need a massive account. You just need to be early.

Nado isn’t open yet you can’t just sign up. It’s invite-only for now. I’ve got 17 invites left, and they expire in 3 days. After that, they’re gone.

Sharing this because a lot of people said “next time” after Lighter.

This might be one of those next times. If you want more, you can DM me.
