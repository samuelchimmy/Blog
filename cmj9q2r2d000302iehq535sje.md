As a Nigerian startup founder, my guiding principle is simple: ***data is the new crude oil, and proprietary data is the refinery*.** You can have great technology, funding, and marketing, but without deep knowledge of your customers’ habits, locations, and spending behavior, you’re building on sand.

This is why OPay’s rise in Nigeria wasn’t luck. It was the deliberate monetization of a decade long data advantage quietly built by [Opera Mini](https://www.opera.com/download).

### Opera Mini: The Hidden Data Engine

OPay didn’t enter Nigeria blind. It was incubated by Opera Software, whose browser once dominated Nigeria’s mobile internet. At its peak, Opera Mini controlled over 80% of Nigeria’s mobile browser market, giving it unmatched visibility into the behavior of millions of unbanked and underbanked users.

Opera understood its audience intimately: highly price sensitive, young, mobile first Nigerians who relied on data compression, browsed from predictable locations, and were already experimenting with digital transactions (See GTWorld’s success). As browsers became low margin commodities, Opera’s real asset wasn’t software anymore it was user intelligence.

The pivot to fintech wasn’t desperation. It was strategy.

### A Data-Led Market Entry

That data dictated OPay’s rollout. Instead of starting with complex financial products, OPay launched high frequency, habit forming services like discounted bike hailing (ORide) and food delivery (OFood). The goal wasn’t logistics dominance; it was trust, visibility, and daily usage.

Real-time usage data then revealed what truly scaled the business: agents and POS transactions. OPay doubled down, rapidly deploying hundreds of thousands of POS terminals nationwide. This data driven focus on transaction volume not hype allowed OPay to outpace competitors at unmatched speed.

### From Usage Data to Credit Scoring Opportunity

Nigeria’s biggest fintech challenge is credit. Traditional banks can’t lend to people without credit histories but OPay doesn’t rely on traditional data. With its super-app ecosystem, it can build alternative credit profiles using bill payments, transfer frequency, transaction volume, and agent reliability.

This is where AI and big data turn behavioral signals into financial inclusion.

### The Architect and the Acquisition

This transformation was unlocked after Opera’s browser business was acquired in 2016 by a Chinese consortium led by [Yahui Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Yahui)’s [Beijing Kunlun Tech](https://www.kunlun.com/en/). What changed hands wasn’t just software it was market position and data rights.

Zhou didn’t build OPay from scratch. He reengineered an aging browser monopoly into a data driven financial empire, proving that the true value of software lies in the intelligence it collects.

### The Trust Question: Data Sovereignty

But a data-first strategy comes with risk. Kunlun was later forced by US regulators to divest Grindr over national security concerns tied to sensitive user data access. That precedent raises valid questions for Nigeria.

OPay holds data far more sensitive than browsing history: transaction flows, BVN/NIN-linked identities, and precise geolocation of users and agents. In a country already sensitive about foreign access to sovereign data as seen in public backlash over tax data sharing agreements trust becomes existential.  
  
The urgency of this concern has been amplified by **recent public backlash over the** [**Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and France on tax data exchange**](https://x.com/NGRPresident/status/1998783204463882393). The outrage was not about taxation itself; it was about *sovereignty*. Nigerians reacted viscerally to the idea that sensitive financial data could be accessed, processed, or stored under foreign jurisdiction.

That reaction exposed a deeper national truth: there is a widening digital trust deficit. Nigerians are increasingly wary of foreign states or corporations having unfettered access to sovereign financial data, seeing it as a potential tool for economic surveillance, leverage, or coercion.

For OPay, long-term dominance now depends on more than growth. It requires absolute clarity on data ownership, local storage, jurisdictional control, and compliance with Nigerian law. Trust must be defended as aggressively as market share was captured.

### The Founder’s Lesson

OPay’s story delivers a clear lesson for Nigerian founders: market domination isn’t about being first or cheapest it’s about knowing your customer better than anyone else. Opera Mini provided that knowledge. OPay simply executed with discipline.

They won the long game by monetizing insight quietly gathered over a decade.
